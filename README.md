MusicSeerr is a self-hosted music request and discovery app built around [Lidarr](https://lidarr.audio/). Search the full MusicBrainz catalogue, request albums, stream music from Jellyfin, Navidrome, Plex, or your local library, discover new albums based on your listening history, and scrobble everything to ListenBrainz and Last.fm. The whole thing runs as a single Docker container with a web UI for all configuration.

## Quick Start

You need Docker and a running [Lidarr](https://lidarr.audio/) instance with an API key.

### 1. Create a docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  musicseerr:
    image: ghcr.io/habirabbu/musicseerr:latest
    container_name: musicseerr
    environment:
      - PUID=1000            # Run `id` on your host to find your user/group ID
      - PGID=1000
      - PORT=8688
      - TZ=Etc/UTC           # Your timezone, e.g. Europe/London, America/New_York
    ports:
      - "8688:8688"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config  # Persistent app configuration
      - ./cache:/app/cache    # Cover art and metadata cache
      # Optional: mount your music library for local file playback.
      # The left side should match the root folder Lidarr uses.
      # The right side (/music) must match "Music Directory Path" in Settings > Local Files.
      # - /path/to/music:/music:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8688/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      start_period: 15s
      retries: 3
```

### 2. Start it

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Configure

Open [http://localhost:8688](http://localhost:8688) and head to Settings. Add your Lidarr URL and API key, then connect whichever streaming and discovery services you use.

## Recommended Stack

MusicSeerr is designed to work with Lidarr. If you're putting together a music stack from scratch, this combination covers most needs:

| Service | Role |
|-|-|
| [Lidarr](https://lidarr.audio/) (nightly recommended) | Library management, download orchestration |
| [slskd](https://github.com/slskd/slskd) | Soulseek download client |
| [Tubifarry](https://github.com/Tubifarry/Tubifarry) | YouTube-based download client for Lidarr |

Lidarr is the only requirement. slskd and Tubifarry are optional but between them they cover most music sourcing needs. For playback, connect Jellyfin, Navidrome, Plex, or mount your music folder directly into the container.

---

## Features

### Search and Request

Search the full MusicBrainz catalogue for any artist or album. Request an album and Lidarr handles the download. A persistent queue tracks all requests, and you can browse pending and fulfilled requests on a dedicated page with retry and cancel support.

### Built-in Player

MusicSeerr has a full audio player that supports multiple playback sources per track:

- Jellyfin, with configurable codec (AAC, MP3, FLAC, Opus, and others) and bitrate. Playback events are reported back to Jellyfin automatically.
- Navidrome, streaming via the Subsonic API.
- Plex Media Server, with direct-play audio streaming and native Plex scrobbling. Supports multi-library setups.
- Local files, served directly from a mounted music directory.
- YouTube, for previewing albums you haven't downloaded yet. Links can be auto-generated or set manually.

The player supports queue management, shuffle, seek, volume control, and a 10-band equalizer with presets.

### Discovery

The home page shows trending artists, popular albums, recently added items, genre quick-links, weekly exploration playlists from ListenBrainz, and "Because You Listened To" carousels personalized to your history.

The discover page goes further with a recommendation queue drawn from similar artists, library gaps, fresh releases, global charts, and your listening patterns across ListenBrainz and Last.fm. Each album can be expanded to show the full tracklist and artwork before you decide to request or skip it.

You can also browse by genre, view trending and popular charts over different time ranges, and see your own top albums.

### Library

Browse your Lidarr-managed library by artist or album with search, filtering, sorting, and pagination. View recently added albums and library statistics. Remove albums directly from the UI.

Jellyfin, Navidrome, Plex, and local file sources each get their own library view with play, shuffle, and queue actions.

### Scrobbling

Every track you play can be scrobbled to ListenBrainz and Last.fm simultaneously. Both are toggled independently in settings. A "now playing" update goes out when a track starts, and a scrobble is submitted when it finishes.

### Playlists

Create playlists from any mix of Jellyfin, Navidrome, Plex, local, and YouTube tracks. Reorder by dragging, set custom cover art, and play everything through the same player.

### Profile

Set a display name and avatar, view connected services, and check your library statistics from a profile page.

### Authentication & Multi-User

MusicSeerr includes an optional authentication system for multi-user deployments:

- **Local accounts** — username and password login. The first account is created at `/setup` and gets admin privileges.
- **Plex SSO** — users can sign in with their Plex account. MusicSeerr verifies they have access to the configured Plex server and creates a local account automatically.
- **Emby SSO** — users can sign in with their Emby credentials. Configure the Emby server URL under Settings > Users & Access.
- **Per-user request limits** — admins can set a request quota (e.g. 10 requests per 7 days) globally or override it per user. Users who hit their quota get a clear error. Admins are always unlimited.
- **User management** — admins can view all accounts, change roles, adjust quotas, toggle request permissions, and remove users from Settings > Users & Access.

Authentication is entirely optional. When disabled, the app behaves exactly as before — no login required.

| Local files | Direct playback from a mounted music directory |

All integrations are configured through the web UI. No config files or environment variables needed beyond the basics listed below.

---

## Configuration

MusicSeerr stores its config in `config/config.json` inside the mapped config volume. Everything is managed through the UI.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `PUID` | `1000` | User ID for file ownership inside the container |
| `PGID` | `1000` | Group ID for file ownership inside the container |
| `PORT` | `8688` | Port the application listens on |
| `TZ` | `Etc/UTC` | Container timezone |

Run `id` on your host to find your PUID and PGID values.

> **Unraid / NAS users:** Unraid defaults to `nobody:users` (PUID=99, PGID=100). If you see `chown: Operation not permitted` at startup, your volume mount is on a filesystem that rejects ownership changes (FUSE/shfs, NFS, CIFS). The container skips `chown` when the directories and their contents are already writable, so this is usually fine as long as the host paths are owned by the correct UID:GID.

### In-App Settings

| Setting | Location |
|-|-|
| Lidarr URL, API key, profiles, root folder, sync frequency | Settings > Lidarr |
| Jellyfin URL and API key | Settings > Jellyfin |
| Navidrome URL and credentials | Settings > Navidrome |
| Plex URL, token (OAuth or manual), music libraries, scrobble toggle | Settings > Plex |
| Local files directory path | Settings > Local Files |
| ListenBrainz username and token | Settings > ListenBrainz |
| Last.fm API key, secret, and OAuth session | Settings > Last.fm |
| YouTube API key | Settings > YouTube |
| Scrobbling toggles per service | Settings > Scrobbling |
| Home page layout preferences | Settings > Preferences |
| AudioDB settings and cache TTLs | Settings > Advanced |
| Require login, user accounts, request quotas | Settings > Users & Access |
| Emby SSO server URL | Settings > Users & Access > Authentication Providers |

### Setting Up Authentication

Authentication is disabled by default. To enable it:

1. Navigate to `/setup` (or visit Settings > Users & Access and follow the prompt) to create the first admin account.
2. Toggle **Require Login** on in Settings > Users & Access.

Once enabled, users can sign in with:
- A local username and password
- Their Plex account (if Plex is configured under Settings > Plex)
- Their Emby account (configure the Emby server URL under Settings > Users & Access > Authentication Providers)

### Setting Up Last.fm

1. Register an app at [last.fm/api/account/create](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) to get an API key and shared secret.
2. Enter them in Settings > Last.fm.
3. Click Authorise and follow the redirect. You'll be returned to MusicSeerr automatically.

### Setting Up ListenBrainz

1. Copy your user token from [listenbrainz.org/profile](https://listenbrainz.org/profile/).
2. Enter your username and token in Settings > ListenBrainz.

### TheAudioDB

AudioDB provides richer artist and album artwork from a fast CDN. It's enabled by default with the free public API key, which is rate-limited to 30 requests per minute. Premium keys from [theaudiodb.com](https://www.theaudiodb.com/) unlock higher limits.

Under Settings > Advanced, you can toggle AudioDB on or off, switch between direct CDN loading and proxied loading (for privacy), enable name-based search fallback for niche artists, and adjust cache TTLs.

---

## Playback Sources

### Jellyfin

Audio is transcoded on the Jellyfin server and streamed to the browser. Supported codecs include AAC, MP3, Opus, FLAC, Vorbis, ALAC, WAV, and WMA. Bitrate is configurable between 32 kbps and 320 kbps. Playback start, progress, and stop events are reported back to Jellyfin.

### Local Files

Mount your music directory into the container and MusicSeerr serves files directly. The mount path inside the container must match the Music Directory Path set in Settings > Local Files.

```yaml
volumes:
  - /path/to/your/music:/music:ro
```

### Navidrome

Connect your Navidrome instance under Settings > Navidrome.

### Plex

Connect Plex under Settings > Plex. You can sign in with Plex OAuth or paste in a token yourself. Once you're connected, choose the music libraries you want to include. If you pick more than one, MusicSeerr merges them into a single library view.

Tracks play directly from Plex with no server-side transcoding. The MusicSeerr backend proxies the stream so your Plex token never reaches the browser.

Plex scrobbling is on by default. Turn it off in Settings > Plex or from the library page if you'd rather rely on Last.fm and ListenBrainz instead.

### YouTube

Albums can be linked to a YouTube URL and played inline. This is useful for listening to albums before you've downloaded them. Links can be auto-generated with a YouTube API key or added manually.

A note on reliability: YouTube playback depends on the embedded player, which can be finicky. It works best in a browser where you're signed into YouTube, and VPNs tend to cause issues. Treat it as a convenience for previewing albums rather than a primary playback source.

---

## Volumes and Persistence

| Container path | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `/app/config` | Application config (`config.json`) |
| `/app/cache` | Cover art cache, metadata cache, SQLite databases |
| `/music` (optional) | Music library root for local file playback |

Map both `/app/config` and `/app/cache` to persistent host directories so they survive container restarts.
