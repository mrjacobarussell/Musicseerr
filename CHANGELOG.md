## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Plex SSO login** — users can sign in with their Plex account instead of a local password. The backend exchanges the OAuth token for user info via plex.tv, verifies the user has access to the configured Plex server, and auto-creates a local account on first sign-in.
- **Emby SSO login** — users can sign in with their Emby username and password. Credentials are validated directly against the configured Emby server (`/Users/AuthenticateByName`). Configure the server URL under Settings > Users & Access > Authentication Providers. Includes a Test Connection button.
- **Per-user request limits** — admins can set a global request quota (max requests per N days) that applies to all regular users. Per-user overrides are also supported. Admins are always unlimited. Users who exceed their quota receive a clear `429` error. New `requested_by` column in request history tracks who made each request.
- **User management UI** — Settings > Users & Access now shows a full user table (admin-only) with inline editing for role, request permissions, and quota overrides. Users can be promoted, demoted, or removed.
- **Admin API** — new `/api/v1/admin/users` and `/api/v1/admin/settings/requests` endpoints for managing users and default quota settings programmatically.
- **`emby_enabled` in auth status** — `/api/v1/auth/status` now includes `emby_enabled` so the login page can show the Emby sign-in option only when it is configured.

### Fixed

- **Plex OAuth login opened a blank tab** — the Plex sign-in popup now includes a `forwardURL` parameter so the browser redirects back to `/login` after authorisation instead of landing on a blank page.
- **Last.fm showed "Connected" even when the API key was rejected** — the settings panel now silently verifies credentials on load and auto-expands the form with an error banner if the stored key is invalid (e.g. after a key rotation).
- **Masked credentials being overwritten on Save** — a double-masking bug caused all seven integration credentials (Navidrome password, Plex token, Jellyfin API key, Lidarr API key, ListenBrainz token, Last.fm api\_key, Last.fm shared\_secret) to be permanently corrupted in the database after the first save. Save and verify handlers now detect the masked sentinel value and fall back to the stored credential instead of writing the mask itself.
- **Route handlers using masked getters for credential resolution** — `update_navidrome_settings`, `update_plex_settings`, and `verify_plex_connection` were resolving the stored password/token through the masked getter, making it impossible for users to recover a corrupted credential by clicking Save. Switched to the `_raw` getters so the real stored value is used.
- **Library sync saturating the event loop** — background pre-cache phases now use an `asyncio.Semaphore(3)` to cap concurrent HTTP requests regardless of batch size, and the default batch sizes and inter-batch delays have been made more conservative (artist images: 10 → 4, albums: 8 → 4; delays: 0.5 s → 1.5 s / 0.3 s → 1.0 s) to reduce impact on app responsiveness.
- **Library sync status showing "Failed" while sync is running** — the Last Sync stat now shows "In progress" while `syncStatus.isActive` is true, preventing the stale `last_sync_success: false` from a previous run being displayed during an active sync.

## [Post-1.0 — Authentication & Security]

_Committed changes after the initial public release, prior to the unreleased work above._

### Added

- **Optional user authentication** (`e1f5e95`) — full opt-in login system with local accounts (username + password), JWT session tokens, and admin/user roles. Auth can be toggled on/off without losing accounts. First account is created at `/setup`.
- **Security headers** (`efce77b`) — `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` headers on every response.
- **Credential masking** (`36ad938`) — all API keys, tokens, and secrets are masked in settings API responses so they are never exposed to the browser after being saved.
- **Avatar file validation** (`faff2a2`) — avatar uploads validate magic bytes against the declared `Content-Type` to prevent content-type spoofing.
- **Rate limiting tightened** (`efce77b`) — stricter per-path rate limits on credential-sensitive endpoints (verify, OAuth flows). Interactive API docs disabled in production.
- **Purple/blue logo variant** (`6158606`) — updated icon with purple-filled eye interior.

### Fixed

- **Auth token not injected in raw fetch calls** (`403f352`) — all direct `fetch()` calls in the frontend now attach the Bearer token.
- **/setup link not clickable when enabling auth with no users** (`9bbaf1c`, `f06e258`) — replaced the inline text link with a proper button and ensured it is always reachable.

### Changed

- **CI: single-pass multi-arch builds** (`83de121`) — Docker images are now built once per architecture and merged into a manifest list, halving CI time.
